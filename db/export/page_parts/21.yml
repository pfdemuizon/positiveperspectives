    h2. Individual Sessions:
    
    Individual sessions are personalized to support each client&#39;s needs and are offered in English or in French. They take place at my office in Palo Alto or Fremont, CA. Phone sessions are also a great option 
    and are just as effective as live sessions. In case you need more support between sessions, I offer *free email support*.
    <table border cellspacing=1 width="75%" style="margin:10px 0 10px 0;">
      <tr><td align="center" width="60%">60-minute session</td><td align="center">$108&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td></tr>
    </table>
    Because change happens over time and to encourage your
    continued growth, I offer discounted, pre-paid packages:
